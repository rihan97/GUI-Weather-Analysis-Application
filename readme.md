#### A graphical user interface application to process and analyse weather data

The aim of this project was to design and write a graphical user interface (GUI) application for various data processing weather analysis. To complete this task historical records of weather, from various locations around the UK were provided in CSV and txt files. An image displaying the ‘rainfall data for Sheffield’ was given in the form of a line graph, this included the; minimum, maximum and average values by year. 
For this a user friendly, industry standard GUI was built which can open the given weather file and analyse the data and share results in a line graph showing various important factors. Java was used and a library called SWING was used.
